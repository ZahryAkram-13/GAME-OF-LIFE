Game of Life - MVC Architecture

Description

This project implements Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. The simulation follows the rules of evolution based on the initial configuration of cells on a grid.

The project is structured using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern to separate concerns and enhance maintainability.
Features

MVC Architecture: The project follows the MVC pattern for a modular and organized codebase.
    Design Patterns: Utilizes design patterns to enhance code clarity and flexibility.
    Game Logic: Implements the rules of the Game of Life for cell evolution.
    Grid Visualization: Provides a graphical representation of the evolving grid.
    Configurable Settings: Adjustable settings for grid size, initial patterns, and simulation speed.
    Custom Cellular Automata:
        Blinker: A simple oscillating pattern.
        Horloge: An evolving pattern resembling a clock.
        Frog: A unique configuration that exhibits interesting behavior.

Technologies

    Java: The core language for implementing the project.
    Swing: Used for creating the graphical user interface.
    Design Patterns: Incorporates design patterns such as Observer for efficient communication between components.

Usage

    Run the Application:
        Execute the main class to start the Game of Life simulation.

    Configure Settings:
        Adjust grid size, initial patterns, and simulation speed as needed.

    Interact with the Grid:
        Observe the evolution of cells on the grid based on the Game of Life rules.
        Experiment with custom cellular automata like Blinker, Horloge, Frog, and more.
